### Hi I am Vipavee KositthaiðŸ‘‹

As a frontend developer student at HackYourFuture Bootcamp, I possess a strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, MySQL, Knex.js, Node.js, and React. 

My love for coding stems from the creative outlet it provides me, as well as the satisfaction of problem-solving and learning new things to overcome obstacles. This passion for coding motivated me to switch career paths from logistics to web development.

I invite you to check out my full-stack app, Meal-Sharing-App, which is available for viewing live on its repository.
